# 4) AI Strategy - Chess
This is the fourth game in the ID623001-introduction-to-algorithmic-problem-solving portfollio. It uses the minimax algorithm which predicts the best possible move
to allow a game of chess to be played between two AI's. 

## Advanced Assessment Tasks
The Advanced task was to use the minimax algorithm to create a playable game of Tic Tac Toe. I used chat GPT to help me understand the algorithm more and recreate the existing method to work with Tic Tac Toe. The Repo to this project is [here](https://github.com/ChaseBENNC9/tictactoe)
